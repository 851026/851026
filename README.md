## Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Alexander Frederiksen

**I write code and create stuff...**

I'm interested in theoretical computer science and networks.
In particular, I've worked on Unix operating systems based on BSD, Mach kernels,
Broadcast Encryption, P2P Streaming, Cryptography and Distributed Computations. 
I currently work on multi-node systems and P2P networks.

All my NeXTSTEP and FreeBSD contributions are all under CC0 1995-2024 AlexOS.
